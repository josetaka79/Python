1. Smart Personal Assistant App – I would create an advanced AI assistant that not only answers questions but also manages tasks like 
scheduling, budgeting, and learning habits. It would integrate with all my devices and help me stay productive.

2. Healthcare Monitoring System – I would develop a program that tracks a person’s health using wearable devices and alerts doctors 
or family members if there are any unusual signs. This could help save lives by providing early warnings.

3. Global Learning Platform – I would design an interactive platform that provides free, high-quality education to people around the 
  world. It would use AI to personalize lessons for each learner, making education more accessible and effective.
